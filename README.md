### Virtual Homemade Friend (VHF)

Added AI-powered Home Assistant. Now your friendly home companion can do more than turn on lights. Watch a video together, and it’ll whisper sweet nothings like, “Did you see that plot twist?!” 

Your Home Assistant just leveled up from smart to suave. Enjoy the ride!
